This add-in gives you full [Polylang](https://wordpress.org/plugins/polylang/) support in WordPress customizer. By full support I mean that you customize each language site differently.

For backward compatibility I've elected to not use customizer changesets (this time).

## Prerequisite

1. Polylang must be installed and activated.
1. Add languages in Admin->Languages.
1. If you have a static front page:
	1. Create a front page per language.
	1. In Admin->Settings-Reading, per language, select the front page.
1. Expect customizer to use setting type = theme_mod (the customizer default) as in:
```php
$wp_customize->add_setting( 'setting_id', [
	'type' => 'theme_mod', // the default, you don't have to set this
 ] );
```

## Install
1. Clone or download this repository into your plugins folder
1. Activate plugin Customizer polylang in wordpress

# Credits

I got the idea from the [customizer-export-import](https://github.com/fastlinemedia/customizer-export-import) plugin.

I did this during work hours at the [Norwegian Government Security and Service Organisation](https://dss.dep.no/english) (DSS). We at DSS believe in sharing code.
